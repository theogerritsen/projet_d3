# Swiss Maps

This repository provides [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson) files for Switzerland from publicly available [swisstopo](http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home.html) geodata. 

## How to reproduce

To generate the TopoJSON files the steps descriped by [Interactive Things](https://github.com/interactivethings/swiss-maps) were followed. However, the descriped steps are difficult to reproduce on Windows and Linux machines. That is the reason why the TopoJSON files are made available in this repository. 

## Available Files

The following TopoJSON files can be found in the topo directory:

* `ch-country.json`
* `ch-cantons.json`
* `ch-districts.json`
* `ch-municipalities.json`
* `ch-plz.json` (zip code boundaries)
* `ch-country-lakes.json` (country boundaries + lakes)
* `ch-cantons-lakes.json` (canton boundaries + lakes)
* `ch-districts-lakes.json` (district boundaries + lakes)
* `ch-municipalities-lakes.json` (municipality boundaries + lakes)
* `ch-lakes.json`
* `ch.json` (all of the above combined)
* For each canton a file with its municipalities and lakes, e.g. `zh-municipalities.json` and `zh-municipalities-lakes.json`

## File characteristics:

* Projected, *cartesian* coordinates
* *Scaled* and *simplified* to a size of **960 Ã— 500** pixels
* *id* The official ID of the feature, i.e., municipality (BFS), canton, district, lake number or zip code

## Projections and Dimensions

The coordinates of the source files is the official Swiss reference system [CH1903](http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/topics/survey/sys/refsys/switzerland.html) with already [projected coordinates](http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/topics/survey/sys/refsys/projections.html).

*This means that if you use D3.js, you must disable the projection* (see this [example of New York Block Groups](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5996232))

```javascript
var path = d3.geo.path()
  .projection(null);
```
